- If two `Employee` objects have the same name, the return value of `compare` is 0.
- It tells us that theses `Employee` objects should be equal but with the given code, it is not always true. Because the `equals()` method in `Employee` is comparing name and salary while NameComparator is comparing only the name.
- This is the Example where the objects have the same name but they are not considered equal.
  - `Employee joe1 = new Employee("Joe", 150000);`
  - `Employee joe2 = new Employee("Joe", 100000);`
- I have rewritten the `compare` method in `EmployeeNameComparator` class.
